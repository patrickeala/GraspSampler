# Grasp-Sampler
Grasp Sampler is a framework that enables you to efficiently sample millions of parallel-jaw grasps around a target object object point cloud. One can quickly generate a dataset that contains numerous grasps and their quality scores.

This repository contains tutorials on how to sample and visualize grasps, render object point clouds, and a sample of the grasp dataset.
